R Script:

A script is written in R to produce the data sets described above.  The name of the script is run_analysis.R.  It
should be run on the directory containing the raw data.  When the script is executed, two files will be produced.
(1) final_data_set.csv
(2) derived_data_set.csv

The final_data_set.csv contains the tidy data set described in step 2 in the codebook.
The derived_data_set.csv contains the derived data described in step 4 in the codebook.

Please see the codebook for details.

The final_data_set.csv is included in the repository.
